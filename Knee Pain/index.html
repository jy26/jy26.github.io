	<h2>Here are some potential causes of your knee pain.</h2>

	<h3>Osgood-Schlatter/Jumper's Knee</h3>
	<p>Osgood schlatter, or otherwise known as Jumper’s Knee, is the most common reason for knee pain in kids and teens. It can be identified by a hard bump right below the kneecap that hurts when they run or jump. 
	It happens when the quadriceps are tight and the knee is overused. So, the inflamed patellar tendon starts pulling on the top of the shinbone causing a bump to form. 
	Luckily it isn’t a serious injury and it will go away on its own with 1 or 2 weeks of rest and ice.
	While resting, it is beneficial to lightly stretch the quadriceps until pain so the tendon won’t pull as much or hard. </p>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<h3>Sprains</h3>
	<p>Sprains are another common reason for knee pain. It is when ligaments are stretched or torn. There are 3 levels of ligament tears: Grade 1, 2, and 3. 
	Grade 1 is a mild tear or stretch, grade 2 is a moderate tear, and grade 3 is a complete tear of the ligament. 
	Grade 1 sprains will heal after 3 or 4 weeks with full strength of the ligament will occur after 6 weeks. 
	Grade 2 sprains take 6 to 12 weeks to heal and braces or taping may be necessary to recover faster. Grade 3 sprains may need surgery and can take anywhere from 3 to 12 months to be fully recovered. 
	It is necessary to wear a brace and do as much as possible to reduce weight on that torn ligament. 
	With all of these sprains, ice, rest, and when possible light stretching and rehabilitation exercises are helpful to a faster recovery. </p>

	<h3>Strains</h3>
	<p>Strains are when muscles or tendons are stretched or torn. Strains can occur from a single explosive movement or repetitive movements over a period of time. 
	Like sprains, there are 3 grades of strains mild, moderate, and complete tear. Like grade 3 sprains, a complete muscle tear may require surgery to heal while the others only require rest and ice. </p>

	<h1>Rehab/Strategies Section</h1>
	<h3>Rest and Ice</h3>
	<p>For all of the common knee injuries, rest and ice are essential to a faster recovery. </p>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<h3>Stretching</h3>
	<p> Light stretching is helpful <b>after the injury is somewhat healed so it doesn’t hurt as much.</b> 
	Increase the intensity of the stretch as the muscle heals. A good benchmark is to stretch until it hurts to maximize the effectiveness of stretching. 
	After the injury heals so it doesn’t hurt to walk around, it is time to do some rehab exercises. Some exercises are slow squats and sissy squats. 
	As with stretching,  go until it hurts with the end goal having a full range of motion without pain. 
	So, for sissy squats, if it hurts to go past 45 degrees, then only go to 45 degrees or place cushions so you can’t go past 45 degrees. 
	Doing this may be frustrating by not being able to go to the ground and up, however it will prevent reinjuring your knee. </p>
